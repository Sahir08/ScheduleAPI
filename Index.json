        "HackSquatsDescription":"Hack squats are a lower body strength exercise performed on a hack squat machine or with a barbell. With feet placed shoulder-width apart and the back against the machine or barbell held behind the legs, the movement involves bending at the knees and hips to lower the body while maintaining a neutral spine, then pushing through the heels to return to the starting position. Hack squats primarily target the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, offering a focused leg workout that can contribute to overall lower body strength and muscle development.",
"RDLs":"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c9/56/01/c9560134126e28ac58bcf787a71e93ee.jpg",
        "RDLDescription":"The Romanian deadlift, also known as the RDL, is a weightlifting exercise focused on targeting the posterior chain muscles. To perform the RDL, start by holding a barbell in front of your thighs with a hip-width grip. Keeping your back straight and knees slightly bent, hinge at your hips while maintaining a neutral spine, lowering the barbell towards the ground. Feel the stretch in your hamstrings and glutes. Reverse the movement by contracting your hamstrings and glutes to stand back up, extending your hips. The RDL helps to improve hip hinge mechanics, strengthen the hamstrings and lower back, and enhance overall posterior chain development.",
"CalfRaises":"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/b6/7b/65/b67b65ddaeae39b321933c803940d8af.jpg",
        "CalfRaisesDescription":"Calf raises are a simple yet effective lower body exercise that involves standing with your feet flat on the ground and then lifting your heels as high as possible by contracting your calf muscles. This motion targets the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in your calves, helping to strengthen and tone them. To perform calf raises, begin by standing upright, then slowly lift your heels off the ground while keeping your core engaged and your back straight. Hold the raised position for a moment before gently lowering your heels back down to the starting position. This exercise can be done with bodyweight or additional weight for added resistance, such as holding dumbbells or using a calf raise machine at the gym. It's essential to maintain proper form and avoid any jerky movements to prevent injury and ensure optimal results."
